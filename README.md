# Atrc (atrc) - Atomic React Components

> Atrc or atrc, short for Atomic React Components, is a versatile collection of React components designed to empower your React projects, with a special emphasis on seamless integration with WordPress. These components follow the atomic design principles, providing a structured and scalable approach to building user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before incorporating Atrc into your React project, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **React Project Setup:** Atrc is designed for React applications, so make sure you have a React project set up and configured.

2. **Node.js and npm:** Atrc is distributed as an npm package. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your development environment. You can download and install them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Use atomic CSS:**
   This project utilizes [Atomic CSS](https://github.com/codersantosh/atomic-css). Ensure that you integrate it into your React project. If you are using it with WordPress, consider using the `wp_enqueue_scripts`, `admin_enqueue_scripts`, `enqueue_block_editor_assets` or any appropriate hooks and in the callback function use `wp_register_style` and `wp_enqueue_style` hooks to load the CSS.

   Example for normal use:

   ```html
   <link
   	rel="stylesheet"
   	href="path/to/atomic.min.css"
   	type="text/css" />
   ```

   Example for WordPress integration:

   ```php
   /* Register Atomic CSS*/
   wp_register_style( 'atomic', 'path/to/atomic.min.css' );

   // Enqueue Atomic CSS stylesheet
   wp_enqueue_style( 'atomic' );
   ```

4. **@wordpress/scripts (Recommended for WordPress Integration):** If you are planning to use Atrc within a WordPress project, it is recommended to set up and use `@wordpress/scripts` for streamlined integration. `@wordpress/scripts` facilitates the integration of React components into WordPress plugins and themes and provides a smooth development experience. You can find more information about `@wordpress/scripts` in the [official documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/packages/packages-scripts/).

5. **Knowledge of Atomic Design Principles:** Familiarize yourself with atomic design principles, as Atrc follows this design methodology. Understanding atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages will help you leverage Atrc's full potential in your project.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you are ready to seamlessly integrate Atrc into your React project and enjoy the benefits of its atomic components.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up Atrc in your local development environment:

## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To install and set up the library, run:

```sh
$ npm install atrc
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add atrc
```

## Usage

Now that you have Atrc installed, you can use the components in your React project. Here's a basic example:

### Import the Atrc components into your React component:

```js
import { AtrcButton, AtrcCheckbox } from 'atrc';
```

### Use the components within your React component:

```js
const MyComponent = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			<AtrcButton onClick={() => console.log('Button Clicked!')}>
				Click me
			</AtrcButton>
		</div>
	);
};
```

### Use CSS:

To utilize the CSS styles provided by Atrc, you can link directly to the `index.css` file located in the `node_modules/atrc/build/` directory.

Example:

```html
<link
	rel="stylesheet"
	href="node_modules/atrc/build/index.css" />
```

Make sure to adjust the path based on your project structure. This CSS file contains the styles for Atrc components and can enhance the visual presentation of your React components. The CSS in Atrc leverages modern CSS concepts, including CSS variables. This makes it easy to override styles if needed. Feel free to customize the provided styles by defining your own CSS variables or by directly targeting and modifying specific elements in your project.

## All available components

Here are [All available components](https://github.com/codersantosh/atrc/blob/master/build/index.js).

### Atrc Components with APIs and Data

The project Atrc also include APIs and Data functionalities that utilize Redux and are designed to interact with WordPress APIs. These features enhance the capabilities of Atrc by providing seamless integration with WordPress and enabling dynamic data handling in your React application.

### Importing Components and Data

Most components in Atrc can be imported using a simpler syntax, like so:

```js
import { AtrcAudio, AtrcButton, AtrcCheckbox, AtrcGetPost } from 'atrc';
```

all listed on [All available components](https://github.com/codersantosh/atrc/blob/master/build/index.js). This syntax allows you to import multiple components in a single line, providing a more concise and convenient way to use Atrc components in your project.

However, some components and data functionalities need to be imported separately due to limitations with tree shaking. Include the following imports in your project:

```js
// Importing specific components
import AtrcEditor from 'atrc/build/atoms/editor';
import AtrcControlCodeTextarea from 'atrc/build/molecules/control-code-textarea';
import AtrcControlImgSizeSelect from 'atrc/build/molecules/control-img/contro-img-size-select';

// Importing data functionalities
import { AtrcApis } from 'atrc/build/data';
```

[atrc/build/data](https://github.com/codersantosh/atrc/blob/master/build/data/index.js) also contains other functionalities.

These separate imports are necessary for components that don't fully support tree shaking. Use them as needed based on your application requirements.
