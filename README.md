# Atrc (atrc) - Atomic React Components

> atrc, short for Atomic React Components, is a versatile collection of React components designed to empower your React projects, with a special emphasis on seamless integration with WordPress. These components follow the atomic design principles, providing a structured and scalable approach to building user interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before incorporating Atrc into your React project, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **React Project Setup:** Atrc is designed for React applications, so make sure you have a React project set up and configured.

2. **Node.js and npm:** Atrc is distributed as an npm package. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your development environment. You can download and install them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **@wordpress/scripts (Recommended for WordPress Integration):** If you are planning to use Atrc within a WordPress project, it is recommended to set up and use `@wordpress/scripts` for streamlined integration. `@wordpress/scripts` facilitates the integration of React components into WordPress plugins and themes and provides a smooth development experience. You can find more information about `@wordpress/scripts` in the [official documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/packages/packages-scripts/).

4. **Knowledge of Atomic Design Principles:** Familiarize yourself with atomic design principles, as Atrc follows this design methodology. Understanding atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages will help you leverage Atrc's full potential in your project.

5. **Use atomic CSS:**
   This project utilizes [Atomic CSS](https://github.com/codersantosh/atomic-css). Ensure that you integrate it into your React project. If you are using it with WordPress, consider using the `wp_enqueue_scripts`, `admin_enqueue_scripts`, `enqueue_block_editor_assets` or any appropriate hooks and in the callback function use `wp_register_style` and `wp_enqueue_style` hooks to load the CSS.

   Example for WordPress integration:

   ```php
   /* Register Atomic css */
    wp_register_style( 'atomic', 'path/to/atomic.min.css' );

   // Enqueue Atomic CSS stylesheet
   wp_enqueue_style( 'atomic' );
   ```

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you are ready to seamlessly integrate Atrc into your React project and enjoy the benefits of its atomic components.
